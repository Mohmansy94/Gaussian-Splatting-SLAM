# SLAM Datasets

This document provides a curated list of datasets commonly used in SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) research. These datasets are categorized based on their sensor types, environmental coverage, and applications. 
They serve as valuable benchmarks for evaluating SLAM methodologies in tracking, mapping, and 3D reconstruction.
